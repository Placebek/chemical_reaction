        <p><b>Chemical reaction</b>, a process in which one or more 
              substances, the reactants, are converted to one or 
              more different substances, the products. Substances
               are either chemical elements or compounds. 
               A chemical reaction rearranges the constituent 
               atoms of the reactants to create different 
               substances as products.
            Chemical reactions are an integral part of technology, 
            of culture, and indeed of life itself. Burning fuels,
             smelting iron, making glass and pottery, brewing beer,
              and making wine and cheese are among many examples of
               activities incorporating chemical reactions that have
                been known and used for thousands of years. 
            Chemical reactions abound in the geology of Earth,
             in the atmosphere and oceans, and in a vast array 
             of complicated processes that occur in all living
              systems.

        <p><b>The five basic types of chemical reactions are:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Combination</li>
                <li>Decomposition</li>
                <li>Single-replacement</li>
                <li>Double-replacement</li>
                <li>Combustion</li>

            </ol>
        </p>
        <div class="clear"></div>
        <h2>Combination</h2>
        <p>A combination reaction, also known as a synthesis reaction,
             is a reaction in which two or more substances combine 
             to form a single new substance. Combination reactions 
             can also be called synthesis reactions .
             The general form of a combination reaction is:
        </p>

        <p>A+B→AB
        </p> 
            
        <p> One combination reaction is two elements combining to form a
             compound. Solid sodium metal reacts with chlorine gas to 
             product solid sodium chloride.
        </p>
            
        <p>(s)+Cl<sub>2</sub>(g)→2NaCl(s)
        </p>
            
        <p> Notice that in order to write and balance the equation
             correctly, it is important to remember the seven elements 
             that exist in nature as diatomic molecules (H<sub>2</sub>
            , N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, Br2, and I2).
            that in order to write and balance the equation
        </p> 
        <p>One sort of combination reaction that occurs frequently 
            is the reaction of an element with oxygen to form an oxide.
             Metals and nonmetals both react readily with oxygen under 
             most conditions. Magnesium reacts rapidly and dramatically
              when ignited, combining with oxygen from the air to produce
               a fine powder of magnesium oxide.
                that in order to write and balance the equation
        </p> 
        <p>2Mg(s)+O<sub>2</sub>(g)→2MgO(s)</p>
        <br/>
        
        <h2>Decomposition Reactions</h2>
        <p>A decomposition reaction is a reaction in which a 
            compound breaks down into two or more simpler
             substances. The general form of a decomposition 
             reaction is:</p>
        <p>AB→A+B</p>
        <p>Most decomposition reactions require an input of energy 
            in the form of heat, light, or electricity.</p>
        <p>Binary compounds are compounds composed of just two
             elements. The simplest kind of decomposition reaction 
             is when a binary compound decomposes into its elements. 
             Mercury (II) oxide, a red solid, decomposes when heated to
              produce mercury and oxygen gas.</p>
        <p>2HgO(s)→2Hg(l)+O<sub>2</sub>(g)</p>
        <p>A reaction is also considered to be a decomposition 
            reaction even when one or more of the products is
             still a compound. A metal carbonate decomposes into a 
             metal oxide and carbon dioxide gas. For example,
              calcium carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide
               and carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s)→CaO(s)+CO<sub>2</sub>(g)</p>
        <p>Metal hydroxides decompose on heating to yield metal 
            oxides and water. Sodium hydroxide decomposes to
             produce sodium oxide and water.</p>
        <p>2NaOH(s)→Na<sub>2</sub>O(s)+H<sub>2</sub>O(g)</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Double-Replacement Reactions</h2>
        <p>A double-replacement reaction is 
            a reaction in which the positive and
             negative ions of two ionic compounds 
             exchange places to form two new compounds. 
             The general form of a double-replacement
              (also called double-displacement) reaction is:
        </p>
        <p>AB+CD→AD+CB</p>
        <p>In this reaction, 
            A and C are positively-charged cations,
             while B and D are negatively-charged anions.
             Double-replacement reactions generally occur 
             between substances in aqueous solution. 
             In order for a reaction to occur, one of
             the products is usually a solid precipitate, 
             a gas, or a molecular compound such as water.
        </p>
        <p>A precipitate forms in a double-replacement reaction 
            when the cations from one of the reactants combine 
            with the anions from the other reactant to form an 
            insoluble ionic compound. When aqueous solutions of 
            potassium iodide and lead (II) nitrate are mixed, the 
            following reaction occurs.
        </p><sub>2</sub>
        <p>2KI(aq)+Pb(NO3)<sub>2</sub>(aq)→2KNO<sub>3</sub>(aq)+PbI<sub>2</sub>(s)</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Single-Replacement Reactions</h2>
        <p>A single-replacement reaction is a reaction in
             which one element replaces a similar element in 
             a compound. The general form of a single-replacement
              (also called single-displacement) reaction is:</p>
        <p>A+BC→AC+B</p>
        <p>In this general reaction, element A is a metal
             and replaces element B, also a metal, in the compound.
              When the element that is doing the replacing is a nonmetal,
               it must replace another nonmetal in a compound, and the 
               general equation becomes:</p>
        <p>Y+XZ→XY+Z</p>
        <p>Y is a nonmetal and replaces the nonmetal Z in the compound with X.</p>
        <p>Magnesium is a more reactive metal than copper. 
            When a strip of magnesium metal is placed in an 
            aqueous solution of copper (II) nitrate, it replaces 
            the copper. The products of the reaction are aqueous
             magnesium nitrate and solid copper metal.</p>
        <p>Mg(s)+Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq)→Mg(NO3)<sub>2</sub>(aq)+Cu(s)</p>
        <p>Many metals react easily with acids, 
            and, when they do so, one of the products 
            of the reaction is hydrogen gas. Zinc reacts 
            with hydrochloric acid to produce aqueous zinc
             chloride and hydrogen (see figure below).</p>
        <p>Zn(s)+2HCl(aq)→ZnCl<sub>2</sub>(aq)+H<sub>2</sub>(g)</p>
        <br/>     
        <h2>Combustion Reactions</h2>
        <p>A combustion reaction is a reaction in which a 
            substance reacts with oxygen gas, releasing energy 
            in the form of light and heat. Combustion reactions 
            must involve O2 as one reactant. The combustion of 
            hydrogen gas produces water vapor (see figure below).</p>     
        <p>2H<sub>2</sub>(g)+O<sub>2</sub>(g)+2H<sub>2</sub>O(g)</p>     
        <p>Notice that this reaction also qualifies as a combination 
        reaction.</p>     
        <p>Many combustion reactions occur with a 
            hydrocarbon, a compound made up solely of 
            carbon and hydrogen. The products of the 
            combustion of hydrocarbons are always carbon 
            dioxide and water. Many hydrocarbons are used
             as fuel because their combustion releases very 
             large amount of heat energy. Propane (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) 
             is a gaseous hydrocarbon that is commonly
              used as the fuel source in gas grills.</p>     
        <p>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>(g)+5O<sub>2</sub>(g)→3CO<sub>2</sub>(g)+4H<sub>2</sub>O(g)</p>
